# Mini Wuzzuf

This project was for the software engineering course. 

**This project went through multiple steps:**

1- Created the use case.

2- Created the sequence diagram for one of the cases.

3- Wrote the SRS document for the project.

4- Created the SQL database in the Oracle SQL server.

5- Linked the database to the program to apply to make the following operations:

  1. Login and Register either as an employer or someone looking for a vacancy.
  2. The person who's looking for an open vacancy can:
       1. Search for the vacancy by keywords or list all the posted vacancies.
       2. Update their information.
       3. Save a job and view all saved jobs.
  3. The employer can:
       1. Search for candidates.
       2. Add or remove a vacancy.
  4. The program can generate two Windows form reports one for the employer to display all the vacancies they posted and the other for all the users as it displays all the vacancies in the database.
